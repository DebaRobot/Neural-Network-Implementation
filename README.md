## Neural Network Implementation
This implementation will show  the various way to implement Neural Network.

Type of Neural Network Implementation 
 1. Regressional Neural Network
 2. Multi Class Classification
 3. Single Layer Perceptron

Use of Keras : 
  1. Defining the model
  2. Number of the input layers
  3. Number of hidden layers
  4. Error Function and many.
  
Uses of TensorFlow:
  1. Matrix Operation
  2. Backward Propogation 
  3. Differential Calculas Operation

Steps Included in the Neural Network process :
  1. Import tensorflow, keras and all basic libraries
  2. Load the datasets
  3. Normalize our datasets
  4. Splitting into training, validating and test set.
  5. Architecture of Our Model
  6. Compiling of our model
  7. Prediction Accuracy of Training and Test Set.

## : The Neural Network Architecture :

  1. Sequential API
  2. Functional API
      a. Restoring and Saving
      b. CallBacks
      c. Finding the Best Model.
      d. Early Stopping
